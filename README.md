# BTC RPC Explorer

Simple, database-free Bitcoin blockchain explorer, via RPC. Built with Node.js, express, bootstrap-v4. This is a fork from janoside's project to be customized for DeepCloud AI's hackathon. 

This tool is intended to be a simple, self-hosted explorer for the Bitcoin blockchain, driven by RPC calls to your own bitcoind node. By deploying several block explorers across the DeepCloud AI Decentralized Network, the Bitcoin network can be even more censorship-resistance, as governments or entities can not simply shut down the site (not that they have a reason to - this is purely hypothetical).

# Features
